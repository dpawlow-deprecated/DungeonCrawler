 You wake up in a dimly lit room, barely remembering falling through a
pit. Looking up you can get a peek of sunshine, it must be the hole
through which you fell.
 Looking around you find out that the room is square and has a door
on each wall. There must be a way out, back to the surface.
Lucky for you, it's possible to get oriented, thanks to the sun.
Time to move on, then.

 You come back to the room in which you woke up. It's still the same
old room, with the sun still shining outside.

 You enter a room with a glass flask on a table in the middle.
The flask contains a red liquid, and a faded out inscription that
barely reads '... Potion'.

 You enter the room were you found the health potion.
The empty flask is lying around somewhere.

 You chug down the contents of the flask.

 You enter a room with walls covered in old and rusty armor. There are
broken weapons lying around everywhere. A little reflection catches your
eye, it is a sheathed sword! And it seems strangely untouched by the
rust that ate the other weapons.
Now you have a sword! It will surely be of some use.
